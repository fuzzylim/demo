# Artifact Storage Quota Solution

## Problem
The repository was hitting GitHub Actions artifact storage quota limits due to accumulating artifacts from the Copilot workflow runs.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Copilot workflow (ID: 180937833) generates "results" artifacts (~300-1500 bytes each)
- Default artifact retention period is 90 days
- Multiple workflow runs accumulate artifacts over time
- Even small artifacts consume storage quota when retained for months

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automated Cleanup Workflow (`.github/workflows/cleanup-artifacts.yml`)
- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Function**: Deletes artifacts older than 7 days
- **Manual trigger**: Available via GitHub Actions UI
- **Impact**: Prevents long-term accumulation of artifacts

### 2. Optimized CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Best practices**: Uses `retention-days: 1` for artifacts
- **Functionality**: Tests MCP Math Server with minimal storage impact
- **Template**: Demonstrates proper artifact management

### 3. Updated Configuration
- **`.gitignore`**: Prevents committing temporary files and artifacts
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for artifact management
- **Actions config**: Default retention settings

### 4. Storage Usage Optimization
- **Before**: Artifacts retained for 90 days (default)
- **After**: Artifacts retained for 1-7 days maximum
- **Reduction**: ~92% reduction in storage usage per artifact

## Expected Impact
- **Immediate**: Manual cleanup can be triggered to resolve current quota issues
- **Ongoing**: Daily automated cleanup prevents future accumulation
- **Long-term**: Short retention periods minimize storage consumption

## Usage Instructions

### Manual Cleanup (Immediate Solution)
1. Go to repository Actions tab
2. Select "Cleanup Old Artifacts" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Wait for completion

### Monitoring
- Check GitHub repository Settings > Actions > General for storage usage
- Review workflow run logs for cleanup activity
- Monitor artifact counts in Actions tab

## Benefits
✅ **Resolves current quota issue**
✅ **Prevents future quota problems**
✅ **Maintains debugging capability for recent runs**
✅ **Fully automated solution**
✅ **No impact on existing functionality**
✅ **Following GitHub best practices**
